And since transit depends on walkability for its success, any trolley system that undermines pedestrian comfort is shooting itself in the foot. If they are truly to offer an alternative to the automobile, bikes and trolleys must displace moving cars, not parked ones"

While most American cities were building more highways, Portland invested in transit and biking. While most cities were reaming out their roadways to speed traffic, Portland implemented a Skinny Streets program. While most American cities were amassing a spare tire of undifferentiated sprawl, Portland instituted an urban growth boundary. "

 With rare exceptions, every transit trip begins and ends with a walk. As a result, while walkability benefits from good transit, good transit relies absolutely on walkability."

Four-way stop signs, which require motorists to approach each intersection as a negotiation, turn out to be much safer than signals."

Often the first item in the budget to be cut, street trees are key to pedestrian comfort and urban livability in so many ways. In addition to offering shade, they reduce ambient temperatures in hot weather, absorb rainwater and tailpipe emissions, provide UV protection, and limit the effects of wind. Trees also slow cars and improve the sense of enclosure by ?necking down? the street space with their canopies. A consistent cover of trees can go a long way toward making up for an otherwise nasty walk.

Induced demand is the name for what happens when increasing the supply of roadways lowers the time cost of driving, causing more people to drive and obliterating any reductions in congestion. "

While almost every other American city has seen its residents drive farther and farther every year and spend more and more of their time stuck in traffic, Portland?s vehicle miles traveled per person peaked in 1996.

A useful experiment was conducted in progressive Palo Alto, California. Real estate developers were allowed to cheat on their parking requirements by as much as 50 percent if the land area saved was turned into a natural ?landscape reserve? that could be converted to parking if the need arose. Not one such reserve has yet to make that conversion"

 Green spaces in cities are a lovely, salubrious, necessary thing. But they are also dull, at least in comparison to shopfronts and street vendors. Our kids may be suffering from nature deficit disorder, but they also know instinctively what we have been taught to ignore, which is that verdant landscapes do not entertain. As Owen further notes, large open areas ?can encourage some people to take walks. But if the goal is to get people to embrace walking as a form of practical transportation, oversized greenways can actually be counterproductive.?12"

 Ultimately, since most cities are not New York, there is a much more important argument to be made for height limits than Gehl?s call for sociability and calm winds. The typical American downtown is not faced with the volume of development, even in good times, that needs tall buildings to contain it. In most places, the challenge is the exact opposite: a preponderance of vacant properties and parking lots, the missing teeth that make walking so unpleasant."

As a result, they tend to sprinkle the walkability fairy dust indiscriminately. They are also optimists?they wouldn?t be in government otherwise?so they want to believe that they can someday attain a city that is universally excellent. This is lovely, but it is counterproductive. By trying to be universally excellent, most cities end up universally mediocre. Walkability is likely only in those places where all the best of what a city has to offer is focused in one area. Concentration, not dispersion, is the elixir of urbanity."

They can also construct the public parking lots a block away that serve employees and shopper overflow."

Some of those trips will be on separated paths, others on bike lanes, and most will be mixing with traffic on slower streets. Some may even be on sidewalks, which surprisingly is still legal in many places. The dream is to get bicyclists where they need to go, not to apportion them a slice of every road, tied up with a bow.

 What makes dedicated-cycle intersections so frustrating to pedestrians is the likelihood that they will have to stand still at almost every street they cross."

 As a result of its unmatched historical and contemporary commitment to automobility, the United States is full of cities that have been shaped or reshaped around the car. Because there have been so many incentives for driving, cars have behaved like water, flowing into every nook and cranny where they have been allowed. Cities with more available space (Houston, Los Angeles) got more cars, while cities with less available space (Boston, New Orleans) got fewer. The first step in reclaiming our urban centers for pedestrians is simply to acknowledge that this outcome was not inevitable, is not the global norm, and need not continue. Despite all the countervailing pressures, it is fully within the capabilities of the typical American city to alter its relationship to the automobile in subtle ways that can have a tremendous impact on walkability?to welcome cars, but on its own terms.

 I provide all this information to communicate the point that, while we Americans may take our great risk of automobile injury for granted, it is actually something that is well within our control?in the long term, as a function of how we design places, and in the short term, as a function of where we choose to live. This discussion becomes particularly ironic when we consider how many people through the decades have decamped from the city into the suburbs ostensibly for the safety of their families. "
