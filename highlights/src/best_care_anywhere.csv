This meant there was a pressing institutional need to coordinate record keeping among the many different VA hospitals and clinics a veteran might use over his or her lifetime. And, crucially, it meant that any improvement to the quality of care the VA could achieve through its investment in information systems would rebound to its own long-term advantage. "

 Of course, medical errors still do occur in the veterans health-care system, and when they do, they are bound to make headlines. But when you see such a headline and wonder how safe veterans hospitals really are, the key question to ask is compared to what?"

The study found that the average male patient had a 40 percent decreased risk of death over the next two years if he was cared for by the VA rather than through the Medicare Advantage program. For women, chances of dying in the next two years were 24 percent less at the VA."

Just the projected increase in the cost of Medicare and Medicaid over the next twenty years is equivalent to doubling the Pentagon's current budget, and there is no end in sight after that.
